## Wordlists, Rules & Masks

This is a work in progress. Small size, big impact custom wordlists, and links to others. Efficacy comparisons including rules and masks

### Custom Tools

- [WordSentry](https://github.com/Root-Down-Digital/pentesting-resources/tree/main/scripts/utilities/passwords#wordsentry-usage) gathers location-specific words for password profiling.

- [PassGen](https://github.com/Root-Down-Digital/pentesting-resources/tree/main/scripts/utilities/passwords#passgen-usage) transforms text files into clean password wordlists using hashcat rules. (Built for use with WordSentry).


### Lists:
